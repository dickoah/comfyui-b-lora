# ComfyUI-B-LoRA

A ComfyUI custom node that loads and applies B-LoRA models.

## What is B-LoRA?

B-LoRA: By implicitly decomposing a single image into its style and content representation captured by B-LoRA, we can perform high quality style-content mixing and even swapping the style and content between two stylized images.

 - üåê Website: https://b-lora.github.io/B-LoRA/

 - Code: https://github.com/yardenfren1996/B-LoRA/

 - Currently B-LoRA models only works with SDXL (`sdxl_base_1.0`). (Compatible but not guaranteed with SDXL-based fine-tuned models.)

## Advantages of B-LoRA

1. Can apply `Style` or `Content`, or both.

2. Much smaller model files. (~100M for SDXL B-LoRAs)

3. One B-LoRA only needs one image as training dataset and 15 minutes to train. (on a single RTX 4090)

Please share your B-LoRA models on Civit.ai or HuggingFace!

## Node

### Load B-LoRA

<img src="nodes/load_b_lora.png" width="400" />

 - `lora_name`: Choose the B-LoRA model you want to load. By default, it'll searches in the `models/loras/` folder for available models.

 - `load_style`: Do you want the style of that B-LoRA?

 - `load_content`: Do you want to content of that B-LoRA?

 - `strength`: How strong do you want that B-LoRA to affect the model?

## Workflow Examples

### A Single Load B-LoRA node

![workflow](workflows/load_b_lora.png)
üåü `<s>` is the training prompt for one B-Lora `colorful-squirrel`

### A B-LoRA for Style, and another for Content

![workflow](workflows/style_plus_content.png)
üåü `<s>` is the training prompt for one B-Lora `colorful-squirrel`, and `<p>` is the training prompt for the other `pencil-boy`.

### B-LoRA models used in the workflows can be downloaded here:

## Train Your B-LoRAs (WIP):

I'm building a docker image for training. Please check [train](./train/README.md) to see current progress.
